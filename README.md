# SER225 RPG Game

## What is this?
Osse Vitae is a spooky, murder mystery RPG game created throughout Quinnipiac University's twelve-week SER225 Agile Development class. The team of five operated in the agile development style to forge this game. Revolving through multiple two-week sprint cycles, the group sharpened their critical thinking, planning, communication, accountability, and collaboration skills. Gaining feedback from the product's target audience throughout the semester allowed the engineers to fix bugs and ensure that the game aligned with the original vision for the horror RPG. Additionally, features such as pop-up jump scares, interactive puzzles, a narrative storyline, interactive NPCs, and an engaging map were prioritized. Agile practices like stand-up meetings, succinct user stories, and sprint retrospectives were essential in the development team's overall collaboration and keeping the project on track.
